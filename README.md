A little bit about me

# Hi there, I am Renita Bharatsingh! 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a student and a budding programmer with a passion for learning new things and solving real-world problems using technology. Currently, I’m exploring the world of **AI** and **software development** through hands-on projects. I'm particularly interested in **physics**, **electrical engineering**, and all things **tech**!

- 🎓 Currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- 💡 I enjoy working on projects that blend technology and problem-solving.
- 👨‍🏫 I love to teach and share what I’ve learned with others.

## 🚀 Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

### 2. Chicken Records Management System 🐔
A system developed for managing chicken records with CRUD operations, reporting features, and an intuitive user interface.

- **Tech Stack**: C , File Handling, Data Structures
- **Features**:
  - **CRUD Operations**: Manage chicken records such as ID, weight, and egg production.
  - **Reporting**: Generate detailed inventory reports with sorting and filtering.
  - **Data Storage**: Text files used for data persistence with sequential search for record retrieval.
  - **User Interface**: Designed a nine-option main menu for easy navigation.
  - **Data Integrity**: Implemented validation checks to ensure accurate record handling.
  - **ERD & Pseudocode**: Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for structured data modeling and developed pseudocode for key functionalities.
  - **Testing**: Executed a comprehensive test plan to ensure reliability and performance.

### Apple Quality Analysis and Prediction Project 🍏
A data mining and machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting apple quality using C++ and MATLAB.

- **Tech Stack**: C++, MATLAB, Data Mining, Machine Learning
- **Features**:
  - **Attribute Analysis**: Developed a C++ program to calculate mean values for apple attributes such as size, weight, and acidity, and to perform quality grading based on sweetness, crunchiness, and juiciness.
  - **Reporting**: Generated reports summarizing mean values, standard deviations, and apple quality categories to provide insights into apple characteristics.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: Conducted correlation analysis using MATLAB to identify relationships between apple attributes, visualized through scatter plots and other visual aids.
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Built a machine learning model in MATLAB to predict apple quality, forecasting the number of good and bad apples to aid decision-making in production and quality control.
  - **Insight Generation**: Provided actionable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and food industry, facilitating informed decisions about apple production.
